What is a Trigger

    A trigger is a special piece of code that runs automatically when certain changes happen in a database.
    It helps you do things automatically when data is added, changed, or removed.



Types of Triggers

    INSERT Trigger:

        What It Does: This trigger runs automatically when you add a new row of data to a table.
        Example: If you add a new employee to an Employees table, an INSERT trigger could automatically
        add an entry to a Log table to record that a new employee was added.

            CREATE TRIGGER trg_before_insert
            BEFORE INSERT
            ON users
            FOR EACH ROW
            BEGIN
                SET new.score = new.score + 50
            END

        Every time a new user is added to the users table, the trigger automatically increases that new users score by 50.



    UPDATE Trigger:

            CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_update
            AFTER UPDATE
            ON users
            FOR EACH ROW
            BEGIN
                SET new.score = old.score + 50
            END

        When an existing users score is updated, automatically add 50 to the new score.



    DELETE Trigger:

            CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_delete
            AFTER DELETE
            ON users
            FOR EACH ROW
            BEGIN
                INSERT INTO DeletedUsers (username, score, deleted_at)
                VALUES (old.username, old.score, NOW())
            END

        When a user is deleted from the users table, log the deleted users score in a separate



We can use DROP command to remove a trigger from the database

    DROP TRIGGER trg_after_insert

    Also, we can use SHOW command to display triggers from the database

        SHOW TRIGGERS IN visonity
