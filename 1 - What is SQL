SQL -> Structured Query Language

    SQL was developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s.
    it was called SEQUEL ( Structured English QUEry Language )


DDL -> Data Definition Language

    Deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

    For Example:
        CREATE DATABASE
        CREATE TABLE
        ALTER TABLE
        ALTER COLUMN
        DROP DATABASE
        DROP TABLE


DCL -> Data Control language

    it includes commands such as GRANT and mostly concerned with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.

    DCL commands are used to control access to data in the database. These commands are essential for
    database security and managing user permissions. The two main DCL commands are:

        GRANT: Gives users access privileges to the database.
        REVOKE: Removes access privileges from users.


DML -> Data Manipulation Language 

    DML commands are used to manage and manipulate data within database tables. The primary DML commands include:

        SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
        INSERT: Adds new rows to a table.
        UPDATE: Modifies existing rows in a table.
        DELETE: Removes rows from a table.


TCL -> Transaction Control Language

    TCL commands manage transactions within a database. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations
    treated as a single unit. The primary TCL commands are:

        BEGIN TRANSACTION: Starts a new transaction.
        COMMIT: Saves the changes made by the transaction permanently.
        ROLLBACK: Undoes the changes made by the transaction.
        SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
        SET TRANSACTION: Sets the properties for a transaction.
